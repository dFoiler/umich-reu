\begin{abstract}
    We consider degenerate principal series $\Ind_P^G\chi$ representations over finite fields, where $G$ is a classical group of even rank, and $P$ is the Siegel parabolic subgroup of matrices of the form $\begin{bsmallmatrix}
        A & B \\ & D
    \end{bsmallmatrix}$. For example, we show that this representation is multiplicity-free and irreducible for most $\chi$. We then discuss a particular intertwining operator $I$ on $\Ind_P^G\chi$ and related combinatorics. A basis of $\Ind_P^G\chi$ provides a matrix representation, leading to families of diagonalizable antitriangular matrices with extraordinarily well-behaved eigenvalues. Lastly, applying $I$ to a special vector in $\Ind_P^G\chi$ leads us to various matrix Gauss sums, whose evaluations imply an explicit equidistribution result of the trace and determinant of symmetric and alternating invertible matrices.

\section{Introduction}
Let $q$ be a prime-power not divisible by $2$ or $3$, and let $2n$ be a positive even integer. For the purposes of the introduction, we work with the group $G\coloneqq\op{SL}_{2n}(\FF_q)$, and we let $P\subseteq G$ denote the subgroup of matrices of the form $\begin{bsmallmatrix}
    A & B \\ & D
\end{bsmallmatrix}$ where $A,B,D\in\FF_q^{n\times n}$. This paper is interested in the degenerate principal series representations $\Ind_P^G\chi$, where $\chi\colon P\to\CC^\times$ is some character, and the combinatorics attached to these representations.

For example, we are able to show that the representation $\Ind_P^G\chi$ tends to be irreducible.
\begin{theorem}
    The representation $\Ind_P^G\chi$ is multiplicity-free. Furthermore, the number of irreducible components equals
    \[\begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if }\chi^2\ne1, \\
        2 & \text{if }\chi^2=1\text{ but }\chi\ne1, \\
        n+1 & \text{if }\chi=1.
    \end{cases}\]
\end{theorem}
The result follows by combining \Cref{prop:ind-irred,prop:ind-mult-free}. In short, we use Gelfand pairs to show that the representation is multiplicity-free, and we use Mackey theory to compute the number of irreducible components.

Anyway, the point is that this representation is reasonably simple. The combinatorics attached to this representation comes from defining a special intertwining operator $I\colon\Ind_P^G\chi\to\Ind_P^G\chi'$ by
\[If(g)\coloneqq\sum_{B\in\FF_q^{n\times n}}f\left(\begin{bmatrix}
    & 1_n \\ -1_n
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
    1_n & B \\ & 1_n
\end{bmatrix}g\right),\]
where $\chi'\colon P\to\CC^\times$ is some other explicitly defined character. When $\chi^2\ne1$, one has that $I\circ I$ is an operator on $\Ind_P^G\chi$; otherwise, when $\chi^2=1$, it turns out that $\chi'=\chi$ so that $I$ is an operator on $\Ind_P^G\chi$.

As such, we see that there are two cases of interest for our operator $I$. On one hand, in the exceptional cases where $\chi^2=1$, we can ask how $I$ acts on the irreducible components of $\Ind_P^G\chi$. For simplicity, we will consider $\chi=1$ for the time being. By choosing a basis of $\Ind_P^G1$, we show the following in \Cref{prop:trivial-matrix-coeffs} and \Cref{thm:eigens-gl}.
\begin{theorem}
    One can give $\Ind_P^G1$ an ordered basis so that the operator $I$ on $\Ind_P^G1$ has matrix given by
    \[\left[(-1)^{r+s-n}\frac{(q;q)_s^2}{(q;q)_{n-r}^2(q;q)_{r+s-n}}q^{n^2-s^2+\binom{r+s-n}2}\right]_{0\le s,r\le n},\]
    where $(a;q)_n\coloneqq\prod_{i=1}^n\left(1-aq^i\right)$ is the $q$-Pochhammer symbol. This matrix is diagonalizable and has eigenvalues given by
    \[\left\{(-1)^{r}q^{\binom n2+\binom{n-r+1}2}:0\le r\le n\right\}.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{example}
    For $n=4$, this matrix is
    \[\begin{bmatrix}  &   &   &   & q^{16}\\  &   &   & q^{15}  & \frac{ ( q - 1 ) }{1} q^{15}\\  &   & q^{12}  & \frac{ ( q^{2} - 1 ) ^{2} }{ ( q - 1 ) } q^{12}  & \frac{ ( q - 1 ) ( q^{2} - 1 ) }{1} q^{13}\\  & q^{7}  & \frac{ ( q^{3} - 1 ) ^{2} }{ ( q - 1 ) } q^{7}  & \frac{ ( q^{2} - 1 ) ( q^{3} - 1 ) ^{2} }{ ( q - 1 ) } q^{8}  & \frac{ ( q - 1 ) ( q^{2} - 1 ) ( q^{3} - 1 ) }{1} q^{10}\\1 & \frac{ ( q^{4} - 1 ) ^{2} }{ ( q - 1 ) }  & \frac{ ( q^{3} - 1 ) ^{2} ( q^{4} - 1 ) ^{2} }{ ( q - 1 ) ( q^{2} - 1 ) } q^{1}  & \frac{ ( q^{2} - 1 ) ( q^{3} - 1 ) ( q^{4} - 1 ) ^{2} }{ ( q - 1 ) } q^{3}  & \frac{ ( q - 1 ) ( q^{2} - 1 ) ( q^{3} - 1 ) ( q^{4} - 1 ) }{1} q^{6}\\\end{bmatrix},\]
    and the eigenvalues are $\left\{q^{16},-q^{12},q^9,-q^7,q^6\right\}$.
\end{example}
\begin{remark}
    Considerations with other classical groups $G$ produces other families of diagonalizable 
\end{remark}
What is remarkable is that we have produced a family of diagonalizable ``antitriangular'' matrices. We are not aware of any general method to handle such diagonalization problems, and it does not appear clear a priori that the eigenvalues listed above should be so well-behaved. Diagonalizing certain antitriangular (satisfying a ``global antidiagonal property'') matrices have combinatorial applications in \cite{britnell-antitriangular}, and some aspects of our methods can be considered $q$-analogues of their arguments, but the analogy is somewhat weak. Notably, the above family of matrices does not satisfy the global antidiagonal property considered there.

On the other hand, we may still be interested in the generic case $\chi^2\ne1$. Here, a matrix representation as above can describe the behavior of $I\circ I$. Another approach would be to choose a particularly special vector of $\Ind^P_G\chi$ and then evaluate $I\circ I$ on this vector; this will determine the entire behavior of $I\circ I$ because $\Ind_P^G\chi$ is irreducible. A particular choice of vector leads us to consider the matrix Gauss sums of \cite{kim-gauss-sum}; the following result is \Cref{prop:i-on-psi-eigen}.
\begin{theorem}
    Fix a nontrivial character $\psi\colon\FF_q\to\CC^\times$. For each character $\chi\colon P\to\CC^\times$, we define a vector $f_\chi\in\Ind_P^G\chi$ as supported on matrices of the form $P\begin{bsmallmatrix}
        & -1_n \\ 1_n
    \end{bsmallmatrix}\begin{bsmallmatrix}
        1_n & B \\ & 1_n
    \end{bsmallmatrix}$ with value
    \[f_\chi\left(p\begin{bmatrix}
        & -1_n \\ 1_n
    \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
        1_n & B \\ & 1_n
    \end{bmatrix}\right)\coloneqq\chi(p)\psi(\tr B).\]
    Then
    \[If_\chi=\Bigg(\sum_{B\in\GL_n(\FF_q)}\chi(\det B)\psi(\tr B)\Bigg)f_{\chi'}.\]
\end{theorem}
Thus, we are motivated to evaluate these Gauss sums. In the case of $G=\SL_{2n}(\FF_q)$, the corresponding Gauss sums given as above have been evaluated in \cite{kim-gauss-sum}. However, considerations of other groups $G$ lead to different sums. For example, $G=\Sp_{2n}(\FF_q)$ leads to a sum over invertible symmetric matrices considered in \cite{saito-sym-gauss-sum}, and $G=\O_{4n}(\FF_q)$ leads to a sum over invertible alternating matrices (which appears to be new).

We provide evaluations for all of these matrix Gauss sums. Our methods are based on an explicit row-reduction analogous to the Bruhat decomposition considerations of \cite{kim-gauss-sum}, but the explicit nature of our exposition allows our proofs over all the various kinds of sums to be rather uniform. For example, even though the sum over invertible symmetric matrices has already been considered in \cite{saito-sym-gauss-sum}, our method seems to be easier to visualize.

Evaluating these Gauss sums also has a combinatorial application: we are able to provide a reasonably explicit formula for the number of invertible matrices (symmetric, alternating, or neither) with given trace and determinant. For general invertible matrices, this application is essentially implicit in \cite[Theorem~6.2]{kim-gauss-sum}, so we state results for symmetric and alternating matrices, which appear to be new. The following results follow from \Cref{cor:count-sym,cor:count-alt}, and they provide a rather explicit equidistribution result for the trace and determinant.
\begin{theorem}
    Fix $d\in\FF_q^\times$ and $t\in\FF_q$. For odd integers $2m+1$, the number $N(d,t)$ of symmetric $A\in\GL_{2m+1}(\FF_q)$ is bounded by
    \[-q^{m(m+1)}(q-1)^{m+1}\cdot\frac{1}{q(q-1)}\le N(d,t)-\frac N{q(q-1)}\le q^{m(m+1)}(q-1)^{m+1}\cdot\frac{q(q-1)-1}{q(q-1)},\]
    where $N$ is the total number of invertible symmetric $(2m+1)\times(2m+1)$ matrices.
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
    There is analogous result for even integers $2m$, but it is slightly more complicated to state.
\end{remark}
\begin{theorem}
    Fix $d\in\FF_q^{\times2}$ and $t\in\FF_q$. For even integers $2m$, the number $N(d,t)$ of alternating $A\in\GL_{2n}(\FF_q)$ is bounded by
    \[-q^{m(m-1)}(q-1)^m\cdot\frac2{q(q-1)}\le N(d,t)-\frac N{q(q-1)/2}\le q^{m(m-1)}(q-1)^m\cdot\frac{q(q-1)-2}{q(q-1)},\]
    where $N$ is the total number of invertible alternating $2m\times2m$ matrices.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Layout}
We quickly explain the outline of the paper. In \cref{sec:rep-theory}, we examine the representation theory of $\Ind_P^G\chi$ and explain where the combinatorial applications arise. In \cref{sec:qcombo}, we provide the diagonalization of our intertwining operator. Lastly, in \cref{sec:gsum}, we evaluate our matrix Gauss sums and provide the combinatorial applications.
